## Material Icons / Material Symbols

These are two different official icon sets from Google, using the same underlying designs. Material Icons is the classic set, while Material Symbols was introduced in April 2022, built on variable font technology.

The icons can be browsed in a more user-friendly way at https://fonts.google.com/icons. Use the popdown menu near top left to choose between the two sets; Material Symbols is the default.


## Icon Requests

We’d love to support your icon needs! Please submit your request here on github as an issue.

Please note that Google Fonts does not accept user submissions of finished icon designs! There are fairly strict  guidelines for Material icons, plus Google has upstream source files from which this repo is generated. Therefore, Google does not accept pull requests for icon files (whether new icon suggestions, or fixes for existing icons). Concepts are appreciated—just don’t design SVGs and submit them via pull request.

However, users are perfectly welcome to point at outside files or images as examples—for the kind of thing they want, but they won’t just be taken “as is.” This works especially well if you have multiple examples for a single icon, to help us understand the “essence” of the idea.

> For example, there is a fairly universal conceptual logo/icon for “agender,” so if you were proposing Google add an agender icon in the Material style, either mentioning that, or pointing at https://www.google.com/search?q=agender+icon would be a helpful tip.

### Third-party logos

Currently, Google does not include 3rd-party logos among the Material Symbols or Material Icons due to legal reasons. Some 3rd-party logos that were included in the past have since been removed.

## npm Packages

Google does not currently maintain the npm package for this repo, past v3 (2016). However, user @marella is hosting the following. He tells us these are automatically updated and published using GitHub Actions. Google does NOT monitor or vet these packages.
